A look into drift detection methodologies.

This project uses simulated user data and enacts a fake product launch.

Time A takes place before the product launch occurred.

Time B is after the product launch occurred, and exists in 3 scenarios:
	- Normal: no change in user behavior resulted from the product launch
	- Growth: product launch was a success, and user engagement increased
	- Decay: product launch was a failure, and user engagement decreased


The goal of this project is to develop multiple drift detection methodologies to compare and contrast different popular methods on the same data set to allow for a deeper understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different drift detection methods.
